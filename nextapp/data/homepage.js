  'We are in the middle of the worst European humanitarian crisis since World War II. The Blue & Yellow Foundation supports those affected by the war in Ukraine with humanitarian aid. We are volunteer-driven, 501c3 certified, and 100% of every donation is tax deductible.',
  'Founded by Ukrainian Americans with direct connections to the civilians suffering on the front lines, the Blue & Yellow Foundation raises funds and supplies for the people most dramatically affected. We work on a strictly volunteer basis, so 100% of donations reach the people who need them. Our work is transparent, moving resources from your hands to the hands of people in need. We share pictures, stories, and reports of the supplies and support we provide to Ukraine, so our donors can see their impact on a regular basis.',
